        <strong>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</strong>
        <br /><br />
        If this is my longterm career, I ideally would want to have the ability
        and the freedom to work remote whilst retatining enough income to allow
        me to travel and live my life. I would say working remote or work for
        myself via cliental or my own business is my end goal
        <br /><br />

          learning?</strong
        >
        <br /><br />
        I feel that my personality trait for teamwork and judgement will be some
        strengths of mine as with teamwork it gives me the ability to work with
        others and bounce ideas and kind of hone my skills alot more in that
        group dynamic and judgement will help self reflect on my work and will
        allow me to kind of keep my work at the standard I want it to be but
        also it will let me gage decisions alot better and more thought out in
        certain situations. I would say a couple of weaknesses of mine are being
        a bit of a perfectionist when it comes to the website design although I
        may not be able to make extremely complex sites yet I still find myself
        being very picky on certain things which can make me stay stuck on task
        for a long period of time. Another weakness would be getting distracted
        easily as this makes me alot less productive when it comes to my
        learning
        <br /><br />

          What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</strong
        >
        <br /><br />
        I would very much like to improve my social skills as I have struggled
        alot with that in the past and although it has improved in the last year
        or two I still would like to continously work on that and become more
        comfortable approaching new people and making conversation. I also would
        like to improve my confidence in general wether that is coding or social
        skills.

        <br /><br />
        I plan to make sure I'm managing my time alot better and interacting
        with my classmates and facilitators when I havent made progress over a
        long period of time and see if they can give me some ideas on how to
        solve the issue. I also plan to allocate time to where I can decompress
        after the day so im not just working 24/7 and getting burnt out really
        quickly which I feel will significantly help me with my learning
        process. I also want to keep maintaining and improving my HTML and Css
        skills so I plan to do a short time period of work improving those
        skills. When I am getting frustrated and annoyed with my course work I
        will take a break and just decompress for a bit by going on a walk or
        doing a form of exercise to help my clear my head and come back with a
        fresh perspective
        <br /><br />

          >A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely
          way?</strong
        >
        <br /><br />
        When I run to issue and situations where I cant think of a solution, I
        will either go to my classmates or facilitators and see if anyone has
        any new perspectives or ideas on the issue at hand otherwise I have some
        of my mates who are studying or in the industry and I will see if I can
        get an idea from them
        <br /><br />
        <strong
          >A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team?</strong
        >
        <br /><br />
        I expect that we are given the freedom to make mistakes and learn from
        them without always needing help but I also would appreciate having that
        kind of safety net, if I cant figure it out to have that help other than
        that I dont really expect much else just that you facilitate to the way
        I learn things Any scheduling information such as block-out times when
        you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau
        commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in. If
        any important events do come up I will make sure I have plan in place to
        complete the work and also let a facilitator know and if I cant manage
        that I will organise time to do it once I am free and again notify a
        facilitator
