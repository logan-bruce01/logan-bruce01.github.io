    <h1>Neuroplasticity:</h1>

      <strong
        >Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits
        people?</strong
      >
      <br /><br />
      By understanding the main principles of neuroplasticity, it allows to
      alter different behaviours or attributes that we have and although some
      things can change significantly short time some can take much much longer
      but the main insight on it is to be proactively recognizing behaviours and
      actions that you want to change and to just take note on when that occurs
      and make plans to action against these occurances and replace it with a
      behaviour you want to incorporate in your life. For example, If you
      consistently spend a certain period of time on social media but want to
      make time to read, you can slowly incorporate readin into that time frame
      by starting off with one or two days a week and then building off of that
      base to 4-5 times a week and so on. Being able to understand what kind of
      behaviours incorporate the principles of neuroplasticity can allow you to
      approach it in a way that allows a more effective way of conditioning that
      change. Hence why it is quite important to understand the border line
      principles of neuroplasticity
      <br /><br />
      <strong
        >Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for
        your benefit?</strong
      >
      <br /><br />
      I think I will incorporate the principles to increase the effectiveness of
      how I learn, I believe I can do this by allowing myself time to absorb
      knowledge and to be able to process and understand it properly as well as
      consistently working on it as it will help with the retention of
      information wether this be doing 20mins of coding or a couple hours of
      javascript. I also want to incorporate challenging exercises that will
      expand and stretch my knowledge.
      <br /><br />
      <strong
        >What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</strong
      >
      <br /><br />
      overall the way to increase neuroplasticity is to allow exposure to new
      enviroments and experiences, For Example, go to a concert or learn
      something new like the guitar by doing this it helps expand your knowledge
      altering your brain composition and creating new neural pathways that
      associate with these new experiences or skillsets.

    <h1>Growth Mindset:</h1>
    <p class="changeFont">
      <strong>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant?</strong>
      <br /><br />
      The growth Mindsetis a change of perspective of how you view things in
      life. It is taking the perspective of failure and altering it into a
      self-development tool instead of the typical tool of de grading and
      negativity towards yourself. For Example, In school if you failed a test
      you would bombarded with comments of how you failed and are incompetent
      because of this, this is one of the negative things about having a fixed
      mindset but if we were to view these in the perspective of a growth
      mindset. Failing a test isnt a setback its an oppurturnity to broaden your
      knowledge and dive into understanding what was done wrong and improving
      your skills and knowledge. This is why the Growth mindset is so important
      especially in education, it allows us to challenge our knowledge of things
      and expand upon that and to peak curiousity and gives the ability to walk
      into new situations without the anxiety and fear of failure as it an
      oppurturnity to develop yourself more.
      <br /><br />
      <strong
        >In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</strong
      >
      <br /><br />
      I found the quote "Confidence is just displayed ability" quite eye opening
      as often we think about how we have to believe in ourselves but this
      contradicts this and instead encourages us to step forward and prove it to
      ourselve first to allow us to have that exterior confidence as we have
      already proven to ourselves we are capable individuals.
      <br /><br />
      <strong>
        How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning
        journey?</strong
      >
      <br /><br />
      When I run into challenging objectives I will try to pursue things that I
      struggle with and learn how to develop my skillset within that through the
      process of trial and error. I also want to allow some lenancy as I
      understand that this is a reasonably new skill to me and with all good
      things being good at something takes time, patience and discipline
      <br /><br />
      <strong
        >Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence
        your learning plan and strategy?</strong
      >
      <br /><br />
      I think by approaching my learning plan with a Growth Mindset it will
      allow me to pursue my limits and to allow myself to fail and learn rather
      than be too scared to explore new things as failure is just another
      oppurturnity for myself to take advantage of it and further expand my
      skillset. I also think taking this mindset into how I view my soft skills
      will be beneficial as it will allow me to be more comfortable wioth being
      awkward at the start as Im still learning and expanding my knowledge
      within that.
