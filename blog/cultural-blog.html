        <strong>What is Emotional Intelligence?</strong>
        <br /><br />
        Emotional Intelligence is essentially having a good understanding of
        emotions that occur in the standard day to day and in high stress
        enviroments and also identifying what those emotions are wether that be
        anger or joy. It is being able to grasp emotions being brought up and
        understanding how to not suppress them but manage them within reason of
        the circumstance, For Example, If someone had made a very rude comment
        to you about your appearance or something, having emotional Intelligence
        is understanding that the best thing in this situation is to walk away
        from that rather than start a fist fight. That is probably one of the
        most simplified examples but emotional intelligence has many complex
        layers to it for every specific situation which makes it a very complex
        technique to navigate without practice.
        <br /><br />
        <strong>How is EQ different to IQ?</strong>
        <br /><br />
        Just like stated in the previous question EQ is defined by the way you
        can identify your emotions and manage them in day to day situations and
        high intensity or high stress situations and to be able to manage them
        appropriately to the situation and to be able to manage your emotions
        around someone elses to, For example, If someone get you this nice gift
        for you but you in turn dont really like it or want it rather than being
        confrontational you can choose to appreciate the thought behind the gift
        because that what is matters like the saying "its the thought that
        counts". Although some people will vary with the level of EQ there are
        many ways to understand and further develop your EQ through discipline
        and perseverance.
        <br /><br />
        <strong> Why is EQ important?</strong>
        <br /><br />
        EQ is extremely important because it shows the levels of Emotional
        Intelligence we have which also corrulates to how we might fit better at
        a management position or in a high stress situation or even as simply to
        how you can discuss a extremely touchy subject with your friend like a
        breakup because those kinds of conversations can be extremely hard to
        navigate without upsetting the other party.
