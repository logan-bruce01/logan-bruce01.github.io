  <title>What is the difference between Margin, Padding, and Border?</title>

  <h1>What is the difference between Margin, Padding, and Border?</h1>

  <!-- <div class="center-container"> -->
  <div class="margin">
    <p>
      Margin: The basis of a Margin is to create space around the content that
      you desirre it too, this can be extremely useful as it helps you position
      things like nav bars and images to where you want. The margin allows us to
      do this as it is a property that exists outside of border and padding
      parameters which means we can use margin to create space from picture to
      picture or anything really. This is the main difference that margin has
      over padding and border because it allows us to manipulate the space
      between content and the positioning.
      <br /><br />
      For Example:
    </p>
    <!-- </div> -->
    <img src="../images/margin.PNG" /><br />
    <p>
      As you can see the margin moves the position of the content from outside
      the box where as padding does the opposite
    </p>
    <br /><br />
  </div>

  <div class="padding">
    <p>
      <strong>Padding:</strong>
      The basis of padding is to align and position content inside the box, this
      is how we identify the difference bewtween using margin and padding. Think
      of it like this when you have a house with a fence around and you want to
      make the fence smaller or bigger do you make changes to the fence(margin)
      or do you make the house(padding) bigger and create space in between the
      house and fence? that is how you should be viewing margin and padding as
      padding makes the "house" bigger and margin changes the space of the
      "fence".
      <br /><br />
      For Example:
      <br /><br />
    </p>

    <img src="../images/padding.PNG" />
    <p>
      As you can see with this picture example it changes the space or position
      of the content withinside the box or border hence why the border has alot
      of space between the picture
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
  </div>

  <div class="padding">
    <p>
      <strong>Border:</strong>
      The border is essentially something used to create a box and identify the
      contents within, It is most commonly used to create an aesthetic to a
      website or to distinguish the content inside on a page to make it more
      prominent
      <br /><br />
      For Example:
      <br /><br />
    </p>

    <img src="../images/margin.PNG" />
  </div>

  <script>
    // Close the dropdown menu if the user clicks outside of it
    window.onclick = function (event) {
      if (!event.target.matches('.dropbtn')) {
        var dropdowns = document.getElementsByClassName('menu-content')
        var i
        for (i = 0; i < dropdowns.length; i++) {
          var openDropdown = dropdowns[i]
          if (openDropdown.classList.contains('show')) {
            openDropdown.classList.remove('show')
          }
        }
      }
    }
  </script>
