      <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        <strong>How were you blocked on a simple problem?</strong>
        <br /><br />
        I found that I struggled with the deBees exercise quite a bit as it was
        outputting the correct result, I ended up using google and console.log()
        to identify the problems which helped alot and then I used the console
        to find where the error was and found that it was because of a spelling
        mistake that caused it to not read the word buzz correctly
        <br /><br />
        <strong>How did you elegantly solved a problem?</strong>
        <br /><br />
        I found I ran into an issue trying to hold the data for the students and
        scores in the gradebook test because intially I was trying to add a new
        object type for every student and then trying to grab the scores for
        each student which did not work. I then realised I could manipulate a
        for loop that grabbed each students individual grades and stored them
        <br /><br />
        <strong>
          Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving
          techniques/processes?</strong
        >
        <br /><br />
        I feel rather confident using most of these techniques as I am very
        comfortable with the likes of using console.log() to identify wether a
        program is outputting result and to find errors in the code however I
        found myself not using much psuedocode which definetely would have made
        writing code alot clearer so next time I will take the time to implement
        it
        <br /><br />
        <strong
          >Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what
          made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next
          time?</strong
        >
        <br /><br />
        I ran into an issue of not being able to run my program through the
        terminal and I was pretty reluctant to ask for help as I found myself
        sort of be littling myself for such a easy thing to do and I suppose I
        felt embarrassed about it. Next time I will try a couple more solutions
        and if they dont work I will ask for help from my peers and teachers
