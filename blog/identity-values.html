          >Your strengths and how they will support you during your learning
          journey.</strong
        >
        <br /><br />
        My five strengths from the VIA Character test is:
        <br />

        <strong>1. Kindness:</strong>
        <br /><br />
        I think this will really help me as I can show kindness to other people
        when they need help with their work but also I can show kindness to
        myself when im frustrated or annoyed about an issue or problem that I am
        running into which will be very beneficial for my mindset going into
        this course
        <br /><br />
        <strong>2. Fairness:</strong>
        <br /><br />
        The way I perceive this is similar to the infamous quote of "treat other
        people how you want to be treated", where I will treat you with fairness
        and kindness in hopes that I will receive the same treatment back which
        will help my learning journey because it will help me with my soft
        skills and the core learning of this course
        <br /><br />
        <strong>3. Forgiveness:</strong>
        <br /><br />
        I feel forgiveness is a key attribute for anyone to have as their is no
        benfeits of holding grudges against poeople and showing judgement to
        other people for mistakes they have made. I feel this will effect my
        learning as I can show forgiveness to myself if I make mistakes and
        continue to proceed with my learning
        <br /><br />
        <strong>4. Teamwork:</strong>
        <br /><br />
        Teamwork is a really big attribute for me personally because I feel
        working in a team enviroment helps create this space of zen(you could
        call it) where everyone is collaborating with each other and it might
        not all be smooth sailing but there will be the ups and down but it also
        removes the pressure because you have other people to go to. For
        example, if you are running into an issue then you can ask one of your
        co-workers to help you with your problem. I also add an aspect of fun
        and enjoyment because your not by yourself, because it is human nature
        to want to be engaging with other people socially and to be around other
        people.
        <br /><br />
        <strong>5. Judgement:</strong>
        <br /><br />
        I think this value is key because it not judgement in the sense of why
        did you do this but how can we fix this and improve this, which I feel
        can bring a whole new perspective to a project and I think it will give
        me good grasp on my learnign techniques and work ethic as I can have
        judgement and dictate wether im doing something right or working on my
        course enough.
        <br /><br />

        <strong>
          Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
          development. How might these affect your learning journey?</strong
        >
        <br /><br />
        I feel I can get distracted very easily and also can lose focus after a
        period of time, this will affect my learning as it will decrease my
        productiivity and will effect how much information I can absorb from the
        course in a certain time period.
        <br /><br />

          >Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
          others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
          tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on
          what other strategies you would try now and why?</strong
        >
        <br /><br />
        When I was in uni, I had a group report that had to be done and
        obviously with it being in covid there was no way for us to meet in
        person and discuss ideas and work on the report. Because of this it
        created alot of tension because of the lack of communication and the
        lack of work being produced, I tried to assign certatin topics of the
        report to the people in the group and although the produced a small
        amount of work it was very minimal and you could tell that not alot of
        effort was produced obviously this created tension on my side of things
        as I wanted to pass, this lead to me asking them to redo their parts of
        the report which did not work. I think my strategy now would be to
        display my work or a standard of work that was appropriate to receive
        the grade we were after and also create a want on their side of things
        to receive a passing grade because this would have lead to them putting
        more effort and work.
