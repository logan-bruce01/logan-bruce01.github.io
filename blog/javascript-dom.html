      DOM is very similar to a Family Tree in the sense of it has multiple parts
      to it, For Example, you have your original ancestor which is the first
      descendant of your family and so on. Very similarly the DOM acts like this
      with the document tag being the original ancestor. Then you have multiple
      siblings and Aunties & Uncles and then you have your cousins and so on.
      Also somewhat similar is that you have your parent who is mutual relative
      of the family tree who has access to the family this is also how DOM works
      to by allowing communication with many different variables of the "Family
      Tree"

      <br /><br />
      Okay lets imagine this, you have a family currently and we look at your
      day to day basis of things that we do, For Example, picking up the kids or
      working at your 9-5 job, this is what we consider to be in a control flow
      where there is this level of hierachy for example everyday you start your
      day by doing a morning routine or whatever that looks like then drop the
      kids off that is apart of the control flow because it is working through
      the hierachy of your day to day activities and then when you go to sleep
      and repeat the same thing the next day that is a loop and they way the
      loop is controlled is until it is told to do something different it will
      continously progress, For Example, for a human the loop ends when we reach
      a certain age and unfortunately pass away that is when the loop ends for
      us (sorry for the gloomy reference :))

        >Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with
        it?</strong
      >
      <br /><br />
      The Document Object Model(DOM) is essentially like a family tree that has
      multiple descendants and descendant of descendants and so on, essentially
      the DOM allows to interact with all these different "descendants", for
      example, when trying to acces a HTML file via a JavaScript File there is a
      certain process you have to follow.
      <br /><br />
      For Example:
    </p>
    <!-- </div> -->
    <img src="../images/doc-tag.PNG" /><br />
    <p>
      As you can see in this example we use something called a document tag that
      allows us to use this getElementsByClassName or ID which allows us access
      to classes and Ids from our associated HTML file, this is extremely
      helpful because it means we can create dynamic and animated actions for
      our website which can enhance user experience. For Example:
    </p>
    <br /><br />
    <img src="../images/innerHTML.PNG" />
    <p>
      There is also sub functions inside the get elements tag that allows us to
      manipulate elements inside our HTML File, lets say we created a simple P
      tag that was empty using that innerHTML tag allows us to write stuff in
      that tag that will display on the website once it is saved
      <br /><br />
      <strong
        >Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and
        objects?</strong
      >
      <br /><br />
      Objects and Arrays are very much similar but slightly different in ways
      for example: A object holds a key and values. an object is often used with
      strings because of it being able to hold limitless amount of variables and
      it is good for holding key values like passwords and usernames
      <br /><br />
      Arrays allow similar attributes as a object but acts more as a list so it
      only holds the amount of variables that is currently given and also
      creates some difficulty when trying to count the items in an array as when
      it is indexed or counted the starting position of the array is 0 rather
      than 1 which often has to be accounted for in coding
      <br /><br />
      For an object to be accessed we first need to create an object for
      example, if we have a object with a name variable in it for instance Logan
      the way we acces this is we use person.name with person being the object
      framework
      <br /><br />
      Where as an array is a defined variable like, lbArray = {"Logan", etc} and
      then if you need to you call it in the HTML or use a getElement tag to
      access in Javascript

  <script>
    // Close the dropdown menu if the user clicks outside of it
    window.onclick = function (event) {
      if (!event.target.matches('.dropbtn')) {
        var dropdowns = document.getElementsByClassName('menu-content')
        var i
        for (i = 0; i < dropdowns.length; i++) {
          var openDropdown = dropdowns[i]
          if (openDropdown.classList.contains('show')) {
            openDropdown.classList.remove('show')
          }
        }
      }
    }
  </script>
