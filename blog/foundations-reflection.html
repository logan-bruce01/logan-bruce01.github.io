          >What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
          due to the core learning?</strong
        >
        <br /><br />
        I was definetely suprised at how much I expected myself to know and how
        fragile my ego was if I didnt know, I found myself stressing and making
        things worse by being negative if I didnt know things at the start but I
        have slowly learned to give myself a bit of credit for what I do know
        <br /><br />
        I was also really suprised at how I managed the problem solving as when
        I was at uni I would have little meltdowns because I couldnt solve
        something but during this process I found myself pushing through and
        understanding that I am still learning and its about the journey not the
        destination
        <br /><br />
        I also found implementing a Growth Mindset outlook has helped not only
        in study but all areas of my life im starting to look at things as
        opportunities and rather looking at downfalls as a bad thing I now look
        at it as a lesson that i needed to learn
        <br /><br />
        <strong
          >What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
          and programming?</strong
        >
        <br /><br />
        From my perspective, I would say values define the interactions between
        you and your team and this can significcantly impact a groups dynamic in
        a positive or negative way. So knowing what values you bring to the team
        and knowing how to manage your less forth-coming characteristics is a
        must as it can allow a better dynamic for yourself and the group.
        Empathy plays a really big part in learning and programming as we are
        all human and we do make mistakes and tend to be rather negative about
        those mistakes, being able to have empathy towards yourself in times of
        stress or confusion or anger can hugely impact the dynamics of your
        learning as it allows you to not be so negative and push through and to
        recognise the amazing work you have already done. Another extremely
        important ingredient to the recipe is self-awareness as being self aware
        can help you recognise emotions that may effect your mood or outlook on
        the work you are currently doing. For example, when i run into an issue
        with my programming and start to get frustrated I can recognise and be
        able to take a break so I can relax for a second, being able to do this
        is so important to the learning process as it helps you not be negative
        and also helps you with getting burnt out less as well
        <br /><br />
        <strong
          >What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</strong
        >
        <br /><br />
        Honestly the growth Mindset suprised me the most, I had read about it
        but never properly introduced into my life and now having done that I
        notice that my perception of challenges and failures can be taken as a
        learning curve or a lesson to be known for the next time I go into a
        situation like that.
        <br /><br />
        <strong
          >What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</strong
        >
        <br /><br />
        I would say looking at my traits and seeing a couple of maybe not the
        best traits but I also have started to understand we are all human and
        everyone has flaws somewhere or a rather and thats what sets us a part
        and defines who we are
        <br /><br />
        <strong
          >Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
          focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp
          course?</strong
        >
        <br /><br />
        I think unlike alot Universities, Dev Academy understand that people
        skills are just as important as our coding skills because any company
        wanting to hire someone will think it is pointless if the person cant
        even properly interact and get along with people let alone a group of
        people whom you will be spending alot of time with.
